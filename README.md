# Intramark
Analyze and modify Markdown-formatted text on the level of Markdown elements to make widespread changes to the text. Automate repetitive tasks that would be tedious to perform manually.

| Note:
|:-
| The name comes from “[intra-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intra-)” and “mark”, a reference to the program's usefulness only *within* a document using Markdown syntax.
