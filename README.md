# Intramark
| Warning:
|:-
| Some modifications are irreversible, so combining them with the `-w / --write-in-place` argument may result in data loss.

Analyze and modify Markdown-formatted text on the level of Markdown elements to make widespread changes to the text. Automate repetitive tasks that would be tedious to perform manually.

The heading syntax follows [0.29 of the CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/), but other Markdown elements may not.

| Note:
|:-
| The name comes from “[intra-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intra-)” and “mark”, a reference to the program's usefulness only *within* a document using Markdown syntax.
